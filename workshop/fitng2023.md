# Interactive Virtual Workshop organized by the Fetal, Infant, & Toddler Neuroimaging Group

FIT’NG is hosting a 10-day virtual workshop series covering basic and advanced methods in developmental EEG/ERP.

-   Where: online
-   When: 20 February - 3 March, 2023
-   Organizers: Dr Lindsay Bowman and Dr Sam Wass
-   More information: <https://fitng.org/virtual-interactive-workshop/>

This workshop provides a much-needed space for developmental EEG/ERP researchers (including advanced users/PIs, novice users, and total beginners) to come together to discuss issues in methodological and analytic techniques uniquely relevant to developmental data (especially from infants, toddlers, and preschool children). The workshop will also showcase cutting edge approaches to using EEG/ERP data to address open questions in developmental research.

In all sessions we aim to:

-   Introduce the basic principles of the featured methodological approach
-   Showcase the methodological approach via examples of current research in the invited speaker’s lab or relevant data,
-   Identify current best practices in the application of the featured approach
-   Brainstorm approaches to determining best practices where they are currently lacking.

The full program can be found [here](https://fitng.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WorkshopSchedule_1.pdf).

On Thursday 2 March Robert Oostenveld will present a lecture on statistical analyses of EEG, focusing on parametric versus non- parametric methods, a priori analyses to estimate sample sizes and how (and why) to report effect sizes. This will be follwed in the same session by a hands-on, in which Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen and Marlene Meyer are available as additional tutors.
