# Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit at the Donders

This 5-day toolkit course (May 9-13, 2022) will teach you advanced MEG and EEG data analysis skills. Pre-processing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction and various statistical methods will be covered. The toolkit will consist of a number of lectures, followed by hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the analysis of a MEG data set using the FieldTrip toolbox.

We hope and expect that we will be able to teach this toolkit on site. Whether or not this will be possible depends on the covid restrictions imposed by the Dutch government. We will notify you in case we need to fall back to an online or hybrid option.

There are 38 places available for this toolkit. The selection of participants will be based on the background experience, the research interest and the expectations on what you will learn (see the questions below). We prefer the group to be reasonably homogeneous in level and expertise of the participants, as this improves the overall interaction.

You can [pre-register here](https://www.ru.nl/donders/agenda/donders-tool-kits/vm-tool-kits/donders-meg-eeg-toolkit/), the deadline for pre-registration is April 10, 2022.

We will inform you as to whether you obtained a place in this course not later than Friday April 22, 2022. The fee for PhD students is € 400; and € 600 for senior researchers; this  fee might be reduced if we have lower expenses due to organizing it completely online.

## Program

To be announced.

## Practicalities

To be announced. We hope to do it in person, but perhaps a hybrid or online form will be needed. In that case we will setup an online interactive environment similar to previous years.

### Test your MATLAB and FieldTrip installation in advance

Since you will be working during the hands-on sessions on your own computer, we recommend that you [test your MATLAB and FieldTrip installation in advance](/workshop/toolkit2022/test_installation).

## Code of conduct

Please spend a couple of minutes to have a look at our [Code of Conduct](/workshop/toolkit2022/code_of_conduct) to make sure we all are taking responsibility to look after each other and make sure we are contributing towards an inclusive and supportive community. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding it. All toolkit participants are responsible to follow the rules listed here, as well as making sure that everyone in the toolkit follows it.
