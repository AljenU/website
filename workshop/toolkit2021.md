# Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit at the Donders

From 19-23 April 2021 we will host the “Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit”. Although we would have loved to welcome you in-person in Nijmegen, the ongoing COVID situation restricts traveling and large meetings. However, [last year](/workshop/toolkit2020) we experienced that in an online format the toolkit course is also really fun, effective and rewarding!

Organizers: Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen.

The toolkit course is aimed at PhD and postdoctoral researchers that already have some experience with EEG and/or MEG data acquisition (eithert a pilot or a full study) and that have a good understanding of their own experimental design. Furthermore, we expect that you know the basics of MATLAB and that you already have some experience with MEG/EEG preprocessing and analysis. We will teach you advanced data analysis methods and cover preprocessing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction, connectivity and various statistical methods. Furthermore, we will give attention to good practices for reproducible research, Open Data and Open Science.

To ensure that we can give sufficient individual attention to everyone, we will limited the number of participants. From past experience we expect the course to be oversubscribed, hence we will start with pre-registration. The final selection of the participants will be based on the motivation, background experience and research interests that you provided in the registration form. The deadline for pre-registration is **March 25, 2021. NOTE: by accident, earlier on the deadline here was mentioned to be the 31st of March, whereas the intended deadline was March 21, as correctly mentioned on the registration website. To accommodate some late subscribers, we decided to keep the registration open until the 25th, so that we can notify everybody on the 26th.**

For (pre)registration please go to the [Donders website](https://www.ru.nl/donders/agenda/donders-tool-kits/vm-tool-kits/donders-meg-eeg-toolkit/).

The toolkit will consist of a number of interactive online lectures, followed by Q&A sessions. Besides lectures we will have interactive hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the complete analysis of a MEG/EEG data set using the FieldTrip toolbox. There will be plenty of opportunity to interact and also ask questions about your research and data. On the final day you will have the opportunity to work on your own dataset under supervision of skilled tutors.

All interactive sessions will take place between 10:00 and 17:00 CET, i.e. centered on the central European time zone. To benefit from the format and interaction, we expect that you will attend online. For some participants that might mean that they have to get up very early, while others might have to stay up very late. We will also record the lectures and provide them for offline viewing at another moment, but especially the participation in Q&A and hands-on sessions requires you being online at the same time as us. If you cannot attend online, but want to watch the lectures anyway, have a look at the [online videos](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/video/) from previous years.

Further details on the toolkit content and format will be posted here. Please also keep an eye on the [email discussion list](/discussion_list) for relevant announcements.

## Program

We are still working on this, but you should expect online interaction to start at 9:00 or 10:00 CET every day, and to be finished around 17:00 CET. We will provide opportunities to get started earlier, and also for interactions with tutors early in the evening.

### Zoom meeting links

The links to the Zoom meeting rooms will be shared in due time with the participants. Please do not distribute them, we do not want to be zoom-bombed. We will have a different link every day, but will stay in the same Zoom room throughout the day, also for the Q&A and hands-on sessions.

### Q&A sessions

During the Q&A following the lectures we will go through any remaining questions that we have collected in the Google doc that we will share with you at the start of each lecture. This will be an interactive session and you can also directly ask your questions here or contribute to the discussion.

### Hands-on sessions

In the hands-on sessions we will take you through selected FieldTrip tutorials. You execute these yourself on your own computer, that is why you need to have access to MATLAB. In the hands-on sessions we will focus on consolidating the kn owledge you aquired during the lectures and we translate it into practical steps in your analysis.

### Playground

On the last day you will apply your newly acquired skills to the analysis of your own data. We will be there to help you with questions and help you to build an analysis pipeline for your research question. We do expect that participants have (some) experience with experimental design and data collection, but in case you don't  have suitable data yet: we caln provide you with data from a variety of EEG or MEG systems and with a variety of experimental paradigms.

## Practicalities

### Slack for communication

It is easy to get lost in teh online world. Not finding the right Zoom link or Google doc, or not knowing which specific URL to follow. Also, when working in breakout rooms you may have a question and get the attention of one of the tutors.

To ensure that we always can find each other, that we can share links and material, and that you can reach the team of tutors (which changes a bit from day to day), we will use Slack. All participants will receive an invitation to join and we will already start using this a few days in advance.

### Test your MATLAB and FieldTrip installation in advance

Since you will be working at home on your own computer (and occasionally share your screen with us), we recommend that you [test your MATLAB and FieldTrip installation in advance](/workshop/toolkit2021/test_installation). This not only served to test their installation, but also to check that all participants knew how to share their notes in a Google doc with the tutors.

## Code of conduct

Please spend a couple of minutes to have a look at our [Code of Conduct](/workshop/toolkit2021/code_of_conduct) to make sure we all are taking responsibility to look after each other and make sure we are contributing towards an inclusive and supportive community. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding it. All toolkit participants are responsible to follow the rules listed here, as well as making sure that everyone in the toolkit follows it.
