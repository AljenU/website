# PracticalMEEG workshop in Aix-en-Provence

PracticalMEEG aims at providing an intensive three–day training to MEG and EEG analysts. It will provide its attendees with the ability to create a full analysis pipeline with exemplar (or their own) data in one or several of four leading software dedicated to MEG and EEG analysis (Brainstorm, FieldTrip, EEGLAB, and MNE-python). On demand, we hope to provide attendees with the opportunity to bridge across toolboxes and weave their own complex multi-software pipeline. More details can be found [here](http://practicalmeeg2019.org).

## Where

The entire meeting will take place at the building named [Le Cube](https://www.univ-amu.fr/fr/public/le-cube-presentation) on the Aix-Marseille University – Schuman Campus. The address is 29 Av. Robert Schuman, 13100 Aix-en-Provence.

## Who

Anne-Sophie Dubarry and Maximilien Chaumon are the local organizers.

The FieldTrip tutorials will be presented and tutored by Robert Oostenveld (from the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, NL) and Christelle Zielinski (from the Institute of Language, Communication and the Brain, Aix-en-Provence, FR)

There will also be other experts from MNE-Python, BrainStorm and EEGLAB with their respective tutorials, and jointly we will organize the plenary lectures.
