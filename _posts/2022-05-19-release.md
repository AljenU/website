### 19 May, 2022

FieldTrip version [20220519](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20220519) has been released. It includes improved functionality in case the MATLAB version used does not have the signal processing toolbox. Also, there's improved functionality of **[ft_resampledata](/reference/ft_resampledata)**, which now allows for an optional anti-aliasing lowpass filter. More information can be found in this [FAQ](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/resampling_lowpassfilter).
See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20220514...20220519) for the detailed list of updates.
