### 10 March, 2022

FieldTrip version [20220310](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20220310) has been released. There are some minor improvements to [edf2fieldtrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website/blob/master/reference/edf2fieldtrip.md), which now returns an event structure (if possible), and to [ft_sourceplot](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website/blob/master/reference/ft_sourceplot.md). The latter function now can tell the difference between Left and Right (given appropriate input), and displays the data with the upside up, avoiding [Mister Potatohead situations](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/my_mri_is_upside_down_is_this_a_problem/). See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20220304...20220310) for the detailed list of updates.
