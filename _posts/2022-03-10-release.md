### 10 March, 2022

FieldTrip version [20220310](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20220310) has been released. It has improvements to [ft_sourceplot](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website/blob/master/reference/ft_sourceplot.md) which now by default displays the data with the upside up, avoiding [Mr Potatohead situations](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/my_mri_is_upside_down_is_this_a_problem/). It also shows Left and Right in the images. Another minor improvement is to [edf2fieldtrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website/blob/master/reference/edf2fieldtrip.md), which now also returns an event structure. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20220228...20220310) for the detailed list of updates.
