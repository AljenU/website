#### Commits

- [5b34490](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/5b34490) FIX - resolved a regression error detected with test_pull1248 in a BrainVision dataset without vmrk file. It now better deals with the situation that there is no marker file and will return an empty event structure.
- [776745d](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/776745d) FIX - resolved regression error in test_issue1601 due to electrodes.tsv the problem was that the readbids option is not a Boolean any more, but the string yes/no/ifmakessense. I moved the BIDS reading code to the start, more in line with the implementation for reading the header
