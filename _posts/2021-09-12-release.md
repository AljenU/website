### 12 September, 2021

FieldTrip version [20210912](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210912) has been released was improved handling of DICOM and NIFTI data formats. In addition, cluster neighboring can be done using based on the spatial relationship between parcels. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210906...20210912) for the detailed list of updates.
