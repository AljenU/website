### 17 September, 2020

Dear fieldtrip users, as communication is an integral part of our work, we're changing our strategy! In addition to what we have been announcing so far (e.g. workshop dates), we will be highlighting the release of new fieldtrip versions with remarkable changes and/or considerable external contribution! 
We will make sure that these announcements reach you either through our website, [our twitter page](https://twitter.com/fieldtriptoolbx) and [our mailing list](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/discussion_list/).
