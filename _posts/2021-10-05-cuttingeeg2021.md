### 05 October, 2021

This week [CuttingEEG2021](https://cuttingeeg2021.org) is taking place as a (in part) real life event, in Aix-en-Provence. Robert and Jan-Mathijs presented a hands-on training to spectrally analyse EEG data on short and long time scales. To this end, we created a brandnew tutorial that also highlights the relative new feature to represent trls and trialinfo fields as tables. The latter feature relies on data being represented in the BIDS-format. Feel free to check out this new tutorial about [time-frequency analysis on short and long timescales](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/cuttingeeg2021/tutorial_freq/).
