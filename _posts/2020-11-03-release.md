### 03 November, 2020

FieldTrip version [20201103](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20201103) has been released. We have added a new function, called [ft_virtualchannel](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/ft_virtualchannel.m) that allows for the creation of virtual channel level data. Also, we made some modifications in how artifacts can be represented. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20201023...20201103) for the detailed list of updates.
