title: ft_write_json
---
```plaintext
 FT_WRITE_JSON writes a MATLAB structure to a JSON file. Compared to the builtin
 MATLAB function, this implementation deals a bit different with missing values,
 booleans, and NaNs, and results in a more human-readable file.

 Use as
   ft_write_json(filename, struct)

 See also FT_READ_JSON, JSONDECODE, JSONENCODE
