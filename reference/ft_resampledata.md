 FT_RESAMPLEDATA performs a resampling or downsampling of the data

 Use as
   [data] = ft_resampledata(cfg, data)

 The data should be organised in a structure as obtained from the FT_PREPROCESSING
 function. The configuration should contain
   cfg.resamplefs      = frequency at which the data will be resampled (default = 256 Hz)
   cfg.detrend         = 'no' or 'yes', detrend the data prior to resampling (no default specified, see below)
   cfg.demean          = 'no' or 'yes', whether to apply baseline correction (default = 'no')
   cfg.baselinewindow  = [begin end] in seconds, the default is the complete trial (default = 'all')
   cfg.feedback        = 'no', 'text', 'textbar', 'gui' (default = 'text')
   cfg.trials          = 'all' or a selection given as a 1xN vector (default = 'all')
   cfg.sampleindex     = 'no' or 'yes', add a channel with the original sample indices (default = 'no')

 Instead of specifying cfg.resamplefs, you can also specify a time axis on which you
 want the data to be resampled. This is usefull for merging data from two acquisition
 devices, after resampledata you can call FT_APPENDDATA to concatenate the channels
 from the different acquisition devices.
   cfg.time        = cell-array with one time axis per trial (i.e. from another dataset)
   cfg.method      = interpolation method, see INTERP1 (default = 'pchip')
   cfg.extrapval   = extrapolation behaviour, scalar value or 'extrap' (default = as in INTERP1)

 Previously this function used to detrend the data by default. The motivation for
 this is that the data is filtered prior to resampling to avoid aliassing and
 detrending prevents occasional edge artifacts of the filters. Detrending is fine
 for removing slow drifts in data prior to frequency analysis, but not good if you
 subsequently want to look at the evoked fields. Therefore the old default value
 'yes' has been removed and you now explicitely have to specify whether you want to
 detrend.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
