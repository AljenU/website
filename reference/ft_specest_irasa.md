```plaintext
 FT_SPECEST_IRASA estimates the powerspectral arrythmic component of the 
 time-domain using Irregular-Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis (IRASA)

 Use as
   [spectrum,ntaper,freqoi] = ft_specest_irasa(dat,time...)
 where
   dat        = matrix of chan*sample
   time       = vector, containing time in seconds for each sample
   spectrum   = matrix of taper*chan*freqoi of fourier coefficients
   ntaper     = vector containing number of tapers per element of freqoi
   freqoi     = vector of frequencies in spectrum

 Optional arguments should be specified in key-value pairs and can include
   taper      = 'dpss', 'hanning' or many others, see WINDOW (default = 'hanning')
   pad        = number, total length of data after zero padding (in seconds)
   padtype    = string, indicating type of padding to be used (see ft_preproc_padding, default: zero)
   freqoi     = vector, containing frequencies of interest
   tapsmofrq  = the amount of spectral smoothing through multi-tapering. Note: 4 Hz smoothing means plus-minus 4 Hz, i.e. a 8 Hz smoothing box
   dimord     = 'tap_chan_freq' (default) or 'chan_time_freqtap' for memory efficiency (only used when variable number slepian tapers)
   polyorder  = number, the order of the polynomial to fitted to and removed from the data prior to the fourier transform (default = 0 -> remove DC-component)
   taperopt   = additional taper options to be used in the WINDOW function, see WINDOW
   verbose    = output progress to console (0 or 1, default 1)

   For application, see Stolk et al., Electrocorticographic dissociation of 
   alpha and beta rhythmic activity in the human sensorimotor system. It
   is recommended the user first sub-segments the data using ft_redefinetrial 
   and specifies cfg.pad = 'nextpow2' when calling ft_frequencyanalysis in 
   order to implement steps A and B of the original algorithm in Wen & liu.
