# FieldTrip buffer Python interface

## Client side pure Python implementation

The directory "fieldtrip/realtime/src/buffer/python" contains a single-file Python module called "FieldTrip.py". This provides classes that wrap FieldTrip-style header structures, events, and client connections to a server, including functions for the various requests to read and write samples and events. The module depends on [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org) for representing data matrices and the `type` and `value` fields of events.

The following Python code example demonstrates how to use the interfac

```python
import sys
import FieldTrip

ftc = FieldTrip.Client()
ftc.connect('localhost', 1972)    # might throw IOError
H = ftc.getHeader()
if H is Non
  print 'Failed to retrieve header!'
  sys.exit(1)

print H
print H.labels

if H.nSamples >
  print 'Trying to read last sample...'
  index = H.nSamples - 1
  D = ftc.getData([index, index])
  print D

if H.nEvents >
  print 'Trying to read (all) events...'
  E = ftc.getEvents()
  for e in
      print e

ftc.disconnect()
```
