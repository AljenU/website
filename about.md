# About the FieldTrip project

FieldTrip is the MATLAB software toolbox for MEG, EEG and iEEG analysis. It offers preprocessing and advanced analysis methods, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the [data formats](/faq/dataformat) of all major MEG systems and of the most popular EEG and iEEG systems. New data formats can be [added easily](/faq/how_can_i_import_my_own_dataformat). FieldTrip contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis protocols as a MATLAB script.

The FieldTrip toolbox is released free of charge as [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) under the GNU [general public license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

FieldTrip is being developed and maintained at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](http://www.ru.nl/donders), part of the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in close collaboration with [collaborating institutes](/external_links#collaborating_institutes). The development of FieldTrip currently receives support from [the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](http://www.nwo.nl) and has previously been supported by the [ChildBrain](http://www.childbrain.eu) project, the [Human Connectome](http://humanconnectome.org) project and by [BrainGain](http://www.braingain.nl).

The development is led by Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, and receives many valuable contributions from present and past colleagues from the Donders and many contributors over the world.
